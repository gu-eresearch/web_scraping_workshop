## Getting started  

Scraping the web for data is

excellent for publically available content - 
probelmatic where there are people involved - privacy issues - 
not so cool to try and scrape data from behind a paywall and so on

examples of webscraping gone bad - 



## Ethical consderations

Befor scraping-
is the data feely publically available

what are the permissions as set by the page owners (robots.txt)

are there people involved?  could their identity or privacy be compromised?

written permissions
