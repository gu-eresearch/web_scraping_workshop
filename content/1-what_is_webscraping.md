Web scraping is the process of scraping webpages for data points. This is to create datasets that are usable for analysis. 
While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. 

"Data displayed by websites can only be viewed using a web browser. Most websites do not allow you to save a copy of this data 
to a storage location or database. If you need the data, the only option is to manually copy and paste the data
- a very tedious job which can take many hours or days to complete. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process,
so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping software will perform the same 
task within a fraction of the time."

Web Scraping is different to Web Crawling in that web scraping is for specific data points and web crawling is to index whole pages. 

Web scraping software will automatically load, crawl and extract data from multiple pages of websites based on your requirement. It is either custom built for a specific website or one which can be configured to work with any website  

Web scraping software can be categorised into:

1. Cloud-based applications or browser applications installed locally on your computer that can scrape data from individual web pages.

2. Coded solutions that use Python and R packages to automate the scraping process from multiple web pages. In this workshop we will look at packages such as Beautifulsoup, Slesium and Scrapy.
