Web scraping the process of scraping webpages for data points and creating a dataset that is usable for analysis. 
While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. 

"Data displayed by websites can only be viewed using a web browser. Most websites do not allow you to save a copy of this data 
to a storage location or database. If you need the data, the only option is to manually copy and paste the data
- a very tedious job which can take many hours or days to complete. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process,
so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping software will perform the same 
task within a fraction of the time."

Web Scraping is different to Web Crawling in that web scraping is for specific data points and web crawling is to index whole pages. 

A web scraping software will automatically load, crawl and extract data from multiple pages of websites based on your requirement. It is either custom built for a specific website or one which can be configured to work with any website  

There are two basic categories of webscraping software,  the first category are browsers or cloud based and installed locally to you computer. This is your webscraper IO type tool and can pull data from individual webapages. 

The second method is to use code to extract the data requried. There are a variety of packages used in Python and R that will scrape data. In this workshop we will look at packages such as beautifulsoup, slesium and scrapy.
