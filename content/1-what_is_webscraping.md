Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. 
The web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. 
While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. 
It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.

Web Scraping is different to Web Crawling in that web scraping is for specific data points and web crawling is to index whole pages. 

A web scraping software will automatically load, crawl and extract data from multiple pages of websites based on your requirement. It is either custom built for a specific website or one which can be configured to work with any website (https://www.webharvy.com/articles/what-is-web-scraping.html)
